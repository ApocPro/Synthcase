# Synthcase

This is a 12U * 100HP case that is can be split into 2 separate 6U units and can be closed patched.  I designed it to be really deep because I build my own modules and some of them are designed with the circuit board connected 90ยบ from the panel.  

I plan to release a shallower version of this in the future for the kit modules that have a much more narrow depth.

It is designed to be laser cut out of 5mm MDF.
