# Synthcase

## Case 1 (on the right in the picture)
This case was designed entirely in Adobe Illustrator to be laser cut out of 5mm MDF.  This was my first attempt at case design and I wasn't sure exactly of the placement of the rails so I drilled them by hand after the fact, which worked fine, but I have since improved my design skills

## Case 2 (on the left in the picture)
This is a 12U * 100HP case that is can be split into 2 separate 6U units and can be closed patched.  I designed it to be really deep because I build my own modules and some of them are designed with the circuit board connected 90ยบ from the panel.  

I plan to release a shallower version of this in the future for the kit modules that have a much more narrow depth.
 
This case was designed in Fusion 360 to be laser cut out of 5mm MDF.
